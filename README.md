Tomedescontos is a promotion aggregator tool which works scrapying all the most famous web forums about promotions in Brazil and offering
the best deals to its users. 

My friends and I are used to access every single day, more than once, about four or five web forums where people like us, promo junkies,
share the best promos of the moment with each other. That's how tomedescontos blew up!

I've built this web tool to make easy our lifes and now we do not need to spend a lot of time jumping from a forum to another one to find
what I want to buy because with this website, I can search for all products which I am interested. Moreover, you can create an alert
for a specific product, see all details about the product you choose such as: actual price, max price, min price, photo, comments and more.
